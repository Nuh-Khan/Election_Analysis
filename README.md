# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me tasks to help complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election.

The tasks were as follows.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Calculate the number of votes and percentage of total votes for each county in the prececint.
3. Calculate which county had the largest number of votes.
4. Get a complete list of candidates that were voted for.
5. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
6. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
7. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

  ## Election-Audit Summary
  This script can be easily modified to assist in looking at any type of election data.
  If we added a list of states instead of countys and altered the dictionary for state votes instead of county votes we could use this script to analyze   a general election for the entire country.
  This script could also look at local elections again by altering the lists and dictionarys within the script. Assuming you have the data to pull from this script could apply to any kind of election.
